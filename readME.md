# **Welcome to Project 1:  TV Maze API Fetch**
###### Project by:  Calvin Suratos, Claire Badger, & Kevin Wolfe

#### **Repository Directions:**
1)  Ensure you're connected to the internet; the project requires an internet connection for API fetch requests and HTML/CSS image links.

2)  Fork and clone the repository by opening your terminal and entering:

    >git clone (github address of the repository)

    Enter your github credentials and clone the repository.

3)  Run 
    
    >npm install 
    
    to install any required dependencies for this repository.

4)  Run

    >npm install node-fetch

    to install fetching.

5)  Run

    >npm test

    to run the Test Driven Development (TDD) code tests.

#### **Project Overview:**
- Build a static webpage
- Layout a well designed static webpage using HTML & CSS
- Make fetch requests to hydrate a static page with data
- Create interactivity using object oriented JavaScript
- Write robust unit tests for JavaScript code

#### **Project Instructions:**
>"You will choose from a list of approved third party API's. Your application must request some data from the API and present it in a human readable and aesthetically pleasing >format. How you decide to present this data and the functionality of the page is mostly up to you, but should follow these guidelines:

    - Should utilize wireframing for planning process
    - Should implement user stories for development progression
    - Should utilize classes with private properties when applicable
    - Should gracefully handle any errors while sending HTTP requests
    - Should have robust unit and integration tests
    - Should present data from API in a human readable format
    - Should present data from API in an aesthetically pleasing format using symantic HTML and CSS
    - Should have event handlers for user interaction
    - Should follow proper TDD practices and patterns in the design process
    - Should contain unit tests that are clear, concise, and allow for edge cases
    - Should pass all tests in its test suite(s)
    - Should contain a README with instructions to new users on how to set up and run the application."

## Teamwork Makes the Dream Work; Or, How We Took This Project to Church
##### API:  TV Maze
##### Problem Statement:  Currently, I/Users don't have any way to know what choices I have for TV shows to watch at a given time of the day; I also am not able to see what they're about before I/Users tune in.

#### Project Planning:
The team coordinated through the use of wireframes on Figma.  This enabled the group to conceive and work up diagrams for what the final project should look like from a pure aesthetic perspective.  Being able to refer back to the wireframes was key to getting the website formatting correct.  

Next, the team created a Trello group to coordinate their efforts on the project.  The project pieces were split into several categories:
    
    - HTML/CSS
    - JavaScript
    - Integration
    - Testing

As the team brainstormed what completing the project would require, Trello task cards were created listing the task that needed to be done, what category the task fell under, to whom the primary responsibility was given for completion, and then filed under "BACKLOG".  

As the project moved forwards, the team would divvy up objectives between themselves during the morning "stand up", with the larger objectives being collaborative efforts (writing the API fetches, integrating disparate pieces of the project, etc.) in line with the program emphasis on "pair programming".  

#### Project Implementation:
**HTML/CSS:**
Basic website formatting achieved through Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).  HTML was written to form the "bones" of the site, with CSS being added to flesh it out to be more functional and aesthetically pleasing.  

**JavaScript:**
For Claire/Calvin to fill in, or Kevin once he looks through the code more.
